This repo contains custom expectations to be used in a [Pest](https://pestphp.com) test suite.

It also contains various helpers to make testing with Pest easier. Imagine, you only want to run a test on GitHub Actions. You can use the `whenGitHubActions` helper to do so.

```php
it('can only run well on github actions', function () {
    // your test
})->whenGitHubActions();
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/pest-expectations
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the [custom expectations](#expectations) and [helpers](#helpers) provided by this package.

### Expectations

#### toPassWith

This expectation can be used to test if [an invokable validation rule](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#using-rule-objects) works correctly.

In this example, the `$value` will be given to `YourValidationRule`. The expectation will pass if your rule passed for the given value.

```php
expect(new YourValidationRule())->toPassWith($value);
```

You can expect the your validation not to pass for the given value, by using Pest's `not()`.

```php
expect(new YourValidationRule()->not()->toPassWith($value);
```

#### toFailWith

This expectation can be used to test if [an invokable validation rule](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#using-rule-objects) did not pass for a given value.

In this example, the `$value` will be given to `YourValidationRule`. The expectation will pass if your rule did not pass for the given value.

```php
expect(new YourValidationRule())->toFailWith($value);
```

Optionally, you can also pass a message as the second argument. The expectation will pass is the validation rule return the given `$message`.

```php
expect(new YourValidationRule())->toFailWith($value, 'This value is not valid.');
```

#### toBeModel

Expect that a value is a model an equal to the passed model.

```php
expect($model)->toBeModel($anotherModel);
```

The expectation will only pass if both models are Eloquent models of the same class, with the same key.

#### toBeArrayOf

Expect that a value is an array of the specified value.

```php
expect(User::all())->toBeArrayOf(User::class);
```

The specified value may be a class name or a class instance, or one of the following string values:
- `'string'`
- `'int'`
- `'float'`
- `'bool'`
- `'scalar'`
- `'array'`
- `'object'`
- `'null'`

```php
expect([1, 2])->toBeArrayOf('int');
expect([true, false])->toBeArrayOf('bool');
expect(['foo', 1, false])->toBeArrayOf('scalar');
```

#### toBeScheduled

Expect that a value is a scheduled job, command or invokable class. The `timezone` parameter, if passed, will also check that the specified timezone was defined.

```php
expect(MyJob::class)->toBeScheduled('0 * * * *', timezone: 'Europe/Paris');
```

Optionally, you may pass a callback that accepts an `Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Event` or `Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\CallbackEvent` instance, so you can run any assertion needed:

```php
expect(MyArtisanCommand::class)->toBeScheduled(function (Event $event) {
    expect($event->getExpression())->toBe('0 0 * * *');
    expect($event->getSummaryForDisplay())->toBe('Foo');
});
```

#### toHaveJsonApiPagination

Expect that a response has JSON:API pagination.
Have a look at our package [spatie/laravel-json-api-paginate](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-json-api-paginate) to see how to add JSON:API pagination to your Laravel app.

```php
$response = $this->get('/');

expect($response)->toHaveJsonApiPagination();
```

### toBeInRange

Expect that a value is in the specified range. The range is inclusive, meaning that the start and end values are included in the range.

The first argument is the start of the range, and the second argument is the end of the range.

```php
expect(5)->toBeInRange(1, 10); // passes
expect(11)->toBeInRange(1, 10); // fails
```

### toBeCloseTo

Expect that a value is close to the specified value. The first argument is the expected value, and the second argument is the deviation.

The deviation is the maximum difference between the expected value and the actual value.

```php
expect(5)->toBeCloseTo(4.89, deviation: 0.1); // fails
expect(5)->toBeCloseTo(4.90, deviation: 0.1); // passes
expect(5)->toBeCloseTo(5.1, deviation: 0.1); // passes
expect(5)->toBeCloseTo(5.11, deviation: 0.1); // fails
```

### Helpers

This package offers various helpers that you can tack on any test. Here's an example of the `whenGitHubActions` helper. When tacked on to a test, the test will be skipped unless you're running it on GitHub Actions.

```php
it('can only run well on github actions', function () {
    // your test
})->whenGitHubActions();
```

To use the helpers, you should call `registerSpatiePestHelpers()` in your `Pest.php` file.

These helpers are provided by this package:

- `whenConfig($configKey)`: only run the test when the given Laravel config key is set
- `whenEnvVar($envVarName)`: only run the test when the given environment variable is set
- `whenWindows`: the test will be skipped unless running on Windows
- `whenMac`: the test will be skipped unless running on macOS
- `whenLinux`: the test will be skipped unless running on Linux
- `whenGitHubActions()`: the test will be skipped unless running on GitHub Actions
- `skipOnGitHubActions()`: the test will be skipped when running on GitHub Actions
- `whenPhpVersion($version)`: the test will be skipped unless running on the given PHP version, or higher. You can pass a version like `8` or `8.1`.

### Assertions

This package also provides a set of custom assertions that you can use in your tests.

In your `TestCase` class, you can use the `CustomAssertions` trait and call the `registerCustomAssertions` method in the `setUp` method.

```php
class TestCase extends \Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase
{
    use CustomAssertions;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $this->registerCustomAssertions();
    }
```

#### assertHasJsonApiPagination

Assert that a response has JSON:API pagination.
Have a look at our package [spatie/laravel-json-api-paginate](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-json-api-paginate) to see how to add JSON:API pagination to your Laravel app.

```php
$this
    ->get('/')
    ->assertHasJsonApiPagination();
```
